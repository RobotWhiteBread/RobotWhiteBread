👋 Hi, I’m @RobotWhiteBread

👀 I’m interested in: Building & Applying LLMs for Environmental Intelligence, Environmental Policy, Data Science for Conservation, Nature-Based Solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced Python for ML, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Large-Scale Data Processing (e.g., Spark basics), Geospatial AI Techniques, Cloud ML Platforms. (Continuing with SQL & R too!)

💞️ I'm a data-driven environmental professional with over a decade of experience leveraging data for policy and conservation across government and NGOs. My foundation is in agricultural statistics, conservation evaluation, and public data systems. Now, I'm diving deep into the intersection of AI and environmental science, specifically focusing on **developing skills in building, training, and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and other deep learning models for environmental intelligence. My goal is to apply cutting-edge AI to analyze complex environmental data – from processing bioacoustic streams and interpreting satellite imagery with transformer architectures to extracting insights from policy documents and scientific literature using LLMs. I'm actively developing these capabilities using **Python, core deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and the Hugging Face ecosystem. I aim to create robust, ethical, and accessible AI-driven tools that enhance our understanding and management of environmental systems. I believe in bridging deep domain expertise with advanced AI capabilities through open innovation.

📫 How to reach me ... Let’s connect if you’re working on LLMs for environmental science/policy, AI for good, climate tech, computational ecology, or public sector tech innovation.
