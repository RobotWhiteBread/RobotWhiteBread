- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobotWhiteBread
- 👀 I’m interested in: Policy. Data. Nature. Designing AI-Driven Tools for Environmental Intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Rstudio, Python, and SQL
- 💞️ I'm a data-driven environmental professional with over a decade of experience in federal service and prior work in state agencies and NGOs across the U.S. and Southern Africa. My career has focused on agricultural statistics, conservation evaluation, and public sector data collection — always grounded in a commitment to using information for better environmental and policy outcomes. Today, I'm expanding my work into the intersection of AI, data science, and environmental systems. I'm especially interested in how emerging technologies, like bioacoustic monitoring, geospatial analysis, and real-time data platforms can transform how we understand ecosystems, monitor wildlife, and evaluate the performance of public institutions. I’m developing innovative tools and research initiatives that blend scientific rigor with public accessibility. I’m passionate about bridging traditional environmental work with forward-thinking tech solutions. I believe in open, ethical innovation that empowers both researchers and communities.
